# Wren:IG

## Overview

Place an identity gateway in front of your applications, microservices, and APIs to ensure consistent security
measures, regardless of their technology or authentication capabilities. Including the most problematic legacy
systems.

Wren:IG is a community‐developed reverse proxy server providing single sign-on (SSO) to any application behind
the proxy. Wren:IG includes a number of pre-built filters to transform data of intercepted requests / responses.
Scripted filter allows you to easily create your own filter using the Groovy language.
