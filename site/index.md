    <h2>
      Why Open Source for Identity Infrastructure
    </h2>
    <p>
      Identity & Access Management (IAM) is not just administrative software – it is critical infrastructure. Choosing an open-source foundation for your IAM stack delivers strategic, operational, and security advantages.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="wren-index-paragraph">
    <strong>Strategic Independence:</strong> Retain full sovereignty over your identity data, deployment models, and integrations. You have the freedom to manage the platform internally or leverage professional partner support on your own terms.
  </p>
  <p class="wren-index-paragraph">
    <strong>Auditability & Verifiable Security:</strong> Trust should be verified. With open source, your security teams can inspect every line of code, run independent security audits, and guarantee there are no hidden vulnerabilities.
  </p>
  <p class="wren-index-paragraph">
    <strong>Continuous Evolution:</strong> Benefit from a platform maintained by dedicated open-source experts. Open standards (OIDC, SAML, LDAPv3) ensure long-term interoperability and guard your infrastructure against technology deprecation.
  </p>
